# Northwind Database Analysis
This project analyzes the Northwind sales database using Python and SQL.  
The goal is to extract business insights such as category performance, demand over time, revenue by country, and top employee results.

## Main Analyses
- Revenue by product category  
- Monthly demand trend for the top category  
- Revenue comparison by country  
- Identification of the best-performing employee  

## How to Run
1. Download this repository.  
2. Place `Northwind.db` in the same folder as the script or notebook.  
3. Open the file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
4. Run all cells to generate the charts and metrics.

## Future Work
This process can be automated using tools like **n8n** or **AI agents** to generate reports and insights automatically.

## Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SQLite.
